# Anomaly-Detection-in-Brain-MRI-Scans-
This project focuses on anomaly detection, specifically the  identification of anomalies in Brain MRI. Leveraging advanced deep  learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and by using Auto Encoder on MRI  scans in DICOM format, and technologies such as TensorFlow and  Keras.
