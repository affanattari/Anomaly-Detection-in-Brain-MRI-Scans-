# Anomaly-Detection-in-Brain-MRI-Scans-
This project focuses on anomaly detection, specifically the  identification of anomalies in Brain MRI. Leveraging advanced deep  learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and by using Auto Encoder on MRI  scans in DICOM format, and technologies such as TensorFlow and  Keras. 
# Problem Statement
Traditional methods of anomaly detection often rely on manual interpretation by radiologists, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to error. Moreover, as medical imaging data continue to grow in complexity and volume, there is an increasing need for automated and efficient anomaly detection techniques.
# Data Set
All BraTS multimodal scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz) and describe a) native (T1) and b) post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), c) T2-weighted (T2), and d) T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) volumes.
